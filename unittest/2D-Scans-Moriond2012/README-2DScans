I am assuming that you have followed the instructions in README, if not that is the best place to start if your new to RapidFit

Again, there are multiple parts to this howto which don't cover all eventualities:

1) Running the Scan
2) ROOT/Ganga issues
3) Configuring the script
4) Post Processing


This procedure has been mostly automated, but is still slightly involved and requires you knowing exactly what you want.


In the case of JpsiPhi a single threaded fit takes about 30-50min to converge. This code has been heavily optimized and without some form of intelligent caching is entirely bound by mathematical calculations.

On the grid you can exploit thousands of CPUs in parallel, but your code must be run in a single thread on each node.



Running the Scan:
=================

The equivalent command you need to run to start the scan is:

(Be sure you set <Threads>1</Threads> in the XML or you WILL get some angry emails from the grid asking why your circumventing their load balancing!)


SetupProject ganga v506r11
ganga 2DLL_Scan_From_XML.py FinalProduction_1fb_U_v4_0p3.xml Bs2JpsiPhi_ntupleB_for_fitting_20120203_sWeighted_0p3.root 2011-1fb-timeAcceptance-v5-Bs-40b.txt 2011-1fb-backgroundangles-0p3-v1.root


run this in the scripts/2D-Scans-Moriond2012 directory.





ROOT/Ganga Issues:
==================

ROOT is a complex beast. In order to build something which can submit run and converge on the grid you need to be consistent in your ROOT version.

I suggest using:

SetupProject ganga v506r11

To provide you with ROOT 5.28 that you will get at runtime on the grid.

I won't go into the details but there are problems with later ganga and ROOT versions. These are the recommended/supported versions I won't go bug hunting on any others!




Configuring the Scan:
======================

The majority of the work in submitting the scan is automated by the script 2DLL_Scan_From_XML.py

It requires some extra configuration to run, but it effectively acts as our executable program within the ganga environment.

Below is a configuration for the JpsiPhi analysis

X_par="Phi_s"
Y_par="deltaGamma"

X_min=-1.
X_max=1.
Y_min=0.
Y_max=0.25

resolution=100
sqrt_jobs_per_core=2


The limits on phis and DGs are clear to see, and the resolution means you will get a 100x100 binning of the 2D plane.

The 'sqrt_jobs_per_core=2' means you will have 2x2=4 points calculated per grid job.
This equates to 2,500 grid jobs!
This taxes ganga on a good day, it will require patience





Post-Processing:
================

I am assuming by this point you have run your scan on the grid or elsewhere and have merged your results into somefile.root

In order to process this output you need to use the tool:

$RAPIDFITROOT/bin/RapidPlot somefile.root


It should automatically determine what is in your output file and perform the appropriate analysis on the data.
